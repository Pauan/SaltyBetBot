* **Q**: Why does the bot bet so low? It's only betting $4,100!

   **A**: The bot tries to win upsets, which means that ~87% of the time it will lose. But when it wins, it wins big. This is the optimal way of betting (as proven by years of analysis).

   However, because it is losing so often, if it bet a large amount then it would be very volatile and it would quickly run out of money. So it bets a small amount so that way it will slowly and steadily gain money over time.

   As you gain more money, it will slowly increase the bet amount, until it reaches a maximum of $32,000 per bet.

   In addition, if the match outcome is uncertain, then it will bet low, in order to prevent losing too much money.

* **Q**: Why does the bot bet so much money? I keep losing all my money!

   **A**: When your money is low, it is better to bet high. That's because even if you lose everything, you're close to bailout. As you gain more money, the bot will automatically bet less.

* **Q**: Why does the bot only bet $1 in exhibitions?

   **A**: It's not possible for bots to bet in exhibitions, because there just isn't enough information (the SaltyBet website does not tell the character names or the palettes, it only tells the team names).

   So as a compromise, it bets $1 in order to gain exp, since that's the best it can do.

* **Q**: Why does the bot go all-in in tournaments?

   **A**: During tournaments you get a separate money pool. Even if you lose all of your tournament money, you will not lose any of your matchmaking money. It is impossible to lose money in tournaments, you can only gain money. So the optimal strategy in tournaments is to all-in, because you have nothing to lose.

* **Q**: Help! The bot stopped betting!

   **A**: [A recent change in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/timer-throttling-in-chrome-88/) causes the bot to break if the SaltyBet tab isn't active. You can  fix this by keeping the SaltyBet tab active, ***or*** you can go to `chrome://flags` and then disable "Throttle Javascript timers in background".

How to build (for programmers only)
===================================

You will need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable).

If you are on Windows, then you also need to install the [Visual Studio build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16) (make sure to enable the "C++ build tools" option).

Then run these commands to setup things:

```
rustup install nightly
rustup override set nightly
yarn
```

You only need to run the above commands one time.

Now you can run this command to build the project:

```
yarn build
```

You need to re-run the above command whenever you make any changes.

Lastly, you can load the `static` folder into Chrome as usual.

Whenever you rebuild you need to reload the extension in Chrome (using the circular arrow).
